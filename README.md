Tor brochure
============

This repository contains sources for three Tor brochures.

These brochures are informational pieces to spread the word about Tor to
the general public.  They will be used at speaking events, conferences,
communications outreach efforts and donor relations materials (such as
press kits).  They will also be available on the Tor website in PDF form.

Audience:  The audience is the general public - people with a wide range
of technical knowledge if any.  Also, most people have an attention span
of 45 - 60 seconds when looking at a piece like this so getting across the
key messages is the focus.

Size:  The brochures are designed to be 4.25 x 5.5 - basically 1/2 of
8.5x11 sheet of paper so that people will be able to easily print them on
one side of one sheet of paper.  They will be put on the Tor website once
done.  Also, we will be printing a limited number of hard copy versions on
a heavier card stock.

Front: Each of the three brochures will have the same front.  The idea is
to have this be a quick glance of about us.

Back:  There are three difference backs:

 1. Law Enforcement:  Geared as a quick reference for law enforcement
    audiences (not just investigators, but also support services as well).

 2. Anonymity:  hopefully will speak to journalist, domestic violence
    organziiations and others focusing on protecting there identity
    online.

 3. Privacy: target audience again is the general public - helping educate
    people why protecting their privacy is important.
